# The Kund Bot
> Dunno man, seems pretty gae to me

This is a realy basic soundboard bot that plays mp3s to annoy people in your server. Currently, this directly plays dem mp3 files from a directory called sounds with the command `*play <filename>`

* Note that most of this is pretty bad code, don't judge me on that. I'm learning, plis don't kill mi

## Problems
* node.js is giving me a warning about some async function and not catching errors, will have to fix that
* Everything lies in the index.js code, will have to seperate them
* Nothing else exists, really, need to figure out more features

## Future plans
*  Add stuff(yaayy!!)
